        <h4>Who was Elise?</h4>

            <p>There are three reigning theories of who the mysterious “Elise” was:<br>
            
            One theory is that it wasn’t an “Elise” at all! The name may have been mistranslated and originally been “Therese.” There was a Therese in Beethoven’s life in 1810: Therese Malfatti von Rohrenbach zu Dezza was a friend and former student of the composer’s. He fell in love with her and proposed marriage in 1810, but was turned down. She was also the owner of the manuscript at the time of its discovery, making this theory highly likely.
            A second theory is that “Elise” meant the German soprano Elisabeth Rockel, another love interest of Beethoven’s. She, too, turned down his marriage proposal and wound up marrying another composer, Johann Nepomuk Hummel, instead.
            A third candidate is another singer named Elise Barensfeld. Therese Malfatti may have been Elise’s piano teacher, and the theory is that Beethoven wrote the relatively easy bagatelle for Therese to teach to Elise. Thus, a favor for Therese wound up being a piece for Elise.

            <p>Whatever the story, Für Elise is undeniably one of the most popular piano pieces in existence. Fun Fact: Für Elise actually brought Mr. and Mrs. Hoffman together! Before she became Mrs. Hoffman, Kelly went to Joseph for piano lessons, wanting to learn Für Elise. After the third lesson, they decided to date instead.</p>

        <p>Frédéric Chopin, French in full Frédéric François Chopin, Polish Fryderyk Franciszek Szopen, (born March 1, 1810, Żelazowa Wola, near Warsaw, Duchy of Warsaw [now in Poland] [see Researcher’s Note: Chopin’s birth date]—died October 17, 1849, Paris, France), Polish French composer and pianist of the Romantic period, best known for his solo pieces for piano and his piano concerti. Although he wrote little but piano works, many of them brief, Chopin ranks as one of music’s greatest tone poets by reason of his superfine imagination and fastidious craftsmanship.</p>
